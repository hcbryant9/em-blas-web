Molly Blasdell is an interdisciplinary artist who specializes in video and sound, often brought together through installation. Their work examines sense of place and self through investigations into memory and its effects on personal identity. Blasdell’s work has been exhibited in the Anderson Gallery as well as Artspace Gallery, and has recently produced an additional work in collaboration with Carl Patow of Artspace. In 2022, they received the Excellence in Kinetic Imaging award from the Anderson Gallery in the Undergraduate Juried Exhibition for their sound installation, Cognizance, as well as in 2023, for their film Egret. In addition to their art practice, Blasdell engages in curatorial work and was nominated to participate in Virginia Commonwealth University’s applied curatorial practices program.
